# Python_Learning

Welcome to my Python playground! This repository is a collection of exercises, mini-projects, and notes as I learn Python from scratch. Whether you're a fellow beginner or just curious, feel free to explore and learn along with me.

## What I'm Learning

- Python basics: variables, data types, operators
- Control flow: `if`, `else`, loops
- Functions and modules
- Working with files
- Error handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Python libraries: `math`, `random`, `datetime`, and more
- Building small projects

## How to Run the Code

1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can check by running:

   ```bash
   python --version
